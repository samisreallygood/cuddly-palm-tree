      <h2>How to avoid lag</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Avoid using create mod belts. Use things like storage trims or item drains.</li>
        <li>If someone has already made a massive farm, consider trading resources with them rather than building another laggy farm.</li>
        <li>If you have several farms running around the world and you are using trains to collect the resources then you do not need to forceload all the chunks that the train will be travelling through. Trains can travel through unloaded chunks.</li>
        <li>Similarly, you do not need to forceload your flower farm. Only forceload the farms that are gathering the resources that you most need like an iron farm.</li>
        <li>Please do try to use the create mod for farms as it compacts them and can make them less laggy.</li>
        <li>I shouldn't have to tell you this but please don't just explode a bunch of TNT because it will obviously crash the server.</li>
        <li>Please do remember that even if your PC can handle it that doesn't mean everyone's can.</li>
