      <h2>Who We Are</h2>
      <p>We are a server that is dedicated to the players. We aim to create a fun, modded minecraft environment. The modpack that is being used is Create: Perfect World. If you don't know how to download modpacks click here. If you do and want to find out more about the modpack you can check out the modpack on curseforge here or watch a youtube series with the pack here.</p>
      <p>don't worry if you do not know much about the mods in the pack. There is a questbook which helps guide you through the main mods but I would recommend watching the series linked above. If you do not know much about the create mod then I would absolutely reccomend looking up a tutorial and also playing with the mod a bit. There is a feature called ponder which tells you abit about the blocks in game.</p>
